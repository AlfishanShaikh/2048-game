# 2048 Game

A clean, responsive web implementation of the popular 2048 sliding tile puzzle. Slide tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine matching numbers and reach the 2048 tile (or beyond!). Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for smooth performance and broad browser compatibility. 
## 🎮 How to Play

- Use **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) or **swipe gestures** on mobile to slide all tiles in one direction.
- Tiles slide until they hit the edge or another tile.
- Matching tiles merge into their sum (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4).
- New 2 or 4 tiles spawn after each move.
- **Win** by creating a 2048 tile. Keep playing for higher scores!
- Game over when no moves remain. 

## 🚀 Features

- Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Real-time score tracking and high score persistence (localStorage).
- Smooth animations and glowing effects for high-value tiles.
- Touch/swipe support for mobile devices.
- No external dependencies – pure vanilla JS.
